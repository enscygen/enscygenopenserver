  "overview": "Fusarium oxysporum is a soilborne fungal pathogen responsible for Fusarium wilt, a devastating disease affecting various crops worldwide. The pathogen colonizes xylem vessels, leading to wilting and plant death. <br> Our culture is available in both test tube slants and petri plates for research applications such as plant pathology, disease resistance studies, and biological control research. Proper storage and handling protocols must be maintained to ensure culture viability and prevent contamination.",
