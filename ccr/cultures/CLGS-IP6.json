  "overview": "Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is a plant pathogenic fungus known to cause anthracnose, a severe disease affecting a wide range of crops. It is considered a major pathogen due to its significant impact on agricultural productivity and plant health.<br> We provide this fungus as a pure culture, available in both petri dishes and test tube slants, specifically for research purposes. These cultures are intended for use in scientific studies, including plant pathology, disease resistance testing, and biocontrol research. To maintain viability and ensure reliable experimental results, proper storage protocols must be followed. This includes maintaining appropriate temperature conditions, preventing contamination, and handling the cultures with care in accordance with biosafety guidelines.",
