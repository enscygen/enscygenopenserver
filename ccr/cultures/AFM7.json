  "overview": "Aspergillus flavus is a saprophytic fungus known for producing aflatoxins, highly toxic secondary metabolites that contaminate food and feed crops. Aflatoxin contamination poses significant health risks and economic losses. <br> We provide this isolate for mycotoxin-related research, including detection methods, resistance studies, and biocontrol strategies. Cultures are maintained under strict biosafety conditions to prevent contamination and ensure research reliability.",
